Intelligent text
*test intelligent text convas renderer crash bug
*change content providing for intelligent text to support non resource based content
*seperate intelligent text core generation functionality for swapping to non unity font based solutions if required
	*thinking about adding dynamic font support by rendering letters to a texture manually

Grid
*remove height data for connected tiles (+ doesn't work when using non 4 sided grid)
*Add serialization
*Add map generation
*Add unit tests
*Add fog of war helpers


General:
*Add generic loading from asset bundles, resources or streaming assets



Grid Generation Notes:
*Define areas in map:
	*Max replicas specification
	*Can rotate
	*Connections
	*Margin from edge (to make sure connections should fit)
	*Environment descriptors
	*define empty areas to assign back to parent area generation
	*fitting area descriptors to fit stuff inside buildings and other areas
	*placement can trigger internal area population/generation call
		*Generation selectors (with order settings (order largest first by default))
		*can override cascading generation to manually apply population of stuff on a its next overall generation step

Connection
* type: required / optional / available = forced connection / possible connection with chance? / available connection locations
*areas with
	*chance
	*bounds
