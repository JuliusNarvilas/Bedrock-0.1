They all have their own merits. Lonely Tree is the worst - not because it's bad, just that it doesn't come up often. Spidicules is marmite (some love, some hate; the model is awesome).
The Green Knight Armor is a minor campaign variant, and more of a challenge mode than anything.
Lion God is ungodly hard, but with the campaign being extended with the Gold Smoke Knight, may be more useful.

Gorm, Dragon King and Sunstalker are considered the best. Flower Knight makes the game easier, Slenderman/Manhunter make it harder.
Dung Beetle Knight and Lion Knight add variation, and DBK is quite fleshed out (as it's one of Adam's favourites) and adds Farming,
whilst the Lion Knight adds resource mixing, and did recently get a buff with the themed survivors being added on for free.
